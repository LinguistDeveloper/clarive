title: CI
---

To paraphrase Wikipedia, the term configuration item (CI) refers to the fundamental structural 
unit of a configuration management system. Clarive is such a configuration management system, 
keeping track of all it's configuration entities as CIs in it's database. 

In Clarive, examples of CIs can be topics (ie. releases, changesets, requirements, test cases), 
servers, user IDs, agents, middleware (such as JBoss or Apache), cloud instances, mainframe nodes, etc. 

Clarive oversees the life of the CIs through a combination of processes and tools by implementing and enabling the fundamental 
elements of security, change management and audits. 

Every CI has its unique Master ID in Clarive ([mid](concepts/mid)).
