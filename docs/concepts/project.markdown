A Project is the most common Clarive security scope. 

A Clarive project is a collection of topics, and is defined according to your 
organization's requirements. For example, a Clarive project could be:

- a software development project
- a system
- a group of software components
- or, more commonly, an application

Topics can belong to none, one or more projects, but that is not a requirement. 
For example, Changeset topics must belong to one, and only one, project.

Releases on the other hand may be multi-project or have no projects.
