<img src="/static/images/icons/project.png" /> A Project is the most common Clarive security scope. 

* A Clarive project is a collection of topics, and is defined according to your 
organization's requirements. For example, a Clarive project could be: <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• A software development project <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;• A system <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;• A group of software components <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;• Or, more commonly, an application.

<br />

* Topics can belong to none, one or more projects, but that is not a requirement. 
For example, Changeset topics must belong to one, and only one, project.

* Releases on the other hand may be multi-project or have no projects.
