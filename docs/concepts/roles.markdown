<img src="/static/images/icons/role.png" height="16px" width="16px" /> Clarive roles are somewhat similar to groups, the main difference being that group membership is global whereas project role membership is project-specific. 

* Additionally, group membership can only be altered by Clarive administrators, whereas project role membership can be altered by project administrators.
