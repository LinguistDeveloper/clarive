The topic is Clarive's central lifecycle entity. 

A **topic category** is an organization-defined form instance that has an associated workflow.
Think of it as a template.

A **topic** is an instance of the topic category, that has an assigned [mid](concepts/mid).

A topic category typically has the following properties:

- A set of statuses
- A workflow
- A form rule, with its defined fieldlets
- Field-level security
- Transition-level security: which user/roles can transition a topic from one status to the next
- A color, to visually represent 
- An acronym, to easily represent the topic category name 
- A discussion

Some topic categories may be:

- Release
- Changeset
- Issue
- Bug or Defect
- Test Case
- Estimation
- Request
- Sprint
- User Story
- Product Backlog

## Why topics?

We believe that every installation must have full control 
over how their process is defined. So having standard, out-of-the-box
entities in a delivery lifecycle tool actually interferes with the 
ground-up thinking that is needed to have the most adapted process.

Topics are great for both brownfield and greenfield implementations, 
as they can ajust and adapt to existing processes, but also help define 
new, unconstrained processes that can best represent the organization needs.
