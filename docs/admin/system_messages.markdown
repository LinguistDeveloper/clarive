* System messages are system-wide notifications
that are posted to all login users. 

* They're useful to notify of upcoming downtime, ie. due to 
maintenance, or publishing change-of-behaviour and lifecycle enhancement notices
to users. 

<br />
### Messaging behaviour

* The messaging campaign starts once the message is published. 
Messages being read are kept count of and can be seen by
the message administrators in the `Read` column, which
indicates how many unique users have seen the message. 

* Clicking on `Read(n)` opens the list of users who have
*dissmissed* the message. Since the message is actually
bothersome, because it limits the access to the menu bar
on top, search and other functions, users are expected to 
dismiss messages by closing them.

### <img src="/static/images/icons/edit.gif" /> Creating a new message

* Enter the `System Messages` admin option. The system messages
window will open with a list of current and previous messages.

* Hit `Compose` to create a new message.  <br />


&nbsp; &nbsp;• **Title**: The message title shown in the upper bar. Keep it short, like "New Release Tip" or "Maintenance scheduled". <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• **Text**: The longer message shown in the upper bar. The title can actually be long, up to 130 is an acceptable title. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• **Expires**: When the message will stop being shown to users <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• **Username**: Direct the message to only a given user. This can be used to quickly message a user that is logged in.  <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• **More Info**: *Optional*. A longer message body, with detailed content.  
The text area accepts even images, where you can explain a new behaviour or phone numbers to call, etc.  <br />

<br />

* Hit `Publish` to broadcast the message immediately. 

<br />
### Testing a new message

* To test a message before making it public, 
we recommend setting the username field to oneself, ie.
the user who is publishing the message. 

* If the message is deemed ready por public 
publishing, just `Clone` the message and re-publish it 
to a larger audience. 

<br />
### Stop broadcasting messages

* Just `Delete` a message from the list. 


<br />
### Cloning an existing message

* This allows for a previous message to be cloned, making easier creating a new messaging
campaign based on a previous one.
