The topic grid is the list of topics that the user can see. 
It's concept is based around that of an email inbox. 

The topic grid can be seen in Clarive in 3 initial modes:

- **All Topics** - opened by selecting the `All` menu option in the Topic menu. 
- **By Project** - opened - **By Category** - opened by selecting a category under the Topic menu. 
by clicking on the project name under the project explorer <img src="/static/images/icons/project.png" />.
<br />

## Sorting 

By default the topic grid sorts by most recently modified
date on top.

To change the criteria, click on the desired column. Each click 
will change the direction of sort (ascending/descending). 
<br />
## Searching

The topic grid can be also filtered by using the Clarive [search syntax](getting-started/search-syntax).
<br />
## Filtering

To filter which topics are shown, use the right side selectors.
<br />
## Statuses

Each topic status has 3 states:

- checked: show topics with this status
- crossed: hide topics with this status
- unselected: hide topics with this status 
(if there's another status checked) or show topics with this status (if there's no other status checked)

Therefore, if no status is checked or crossed, then all statuses are shown. 
<br />
## Categories

Check the topic categories you want to see. If no categories are selected, shows all categories.
