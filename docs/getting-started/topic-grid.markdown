* The topic grid is the list of topics that the user can see. 
It's concept is based around that of an email inbox. 

* The topic grid can be seen in Clarive in 3 initial modes:  <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• **All Topics** - opened by selecting the `All` menu option in the Topic menu.  <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;• **By Category** - opened by selecting a category under the Topic menu.  <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;• **By Project** - opened by clicking on the project name under the project explorer <img src="/static/images/icons/project.png" />.

<br />
### Sorting 

* By default the topic grid sorts by most recently modified
date on top.

* To change the criteria, click on the desired column. Each click 
will change the direction of sort (ascending/descending). 

<br />
### Searching

* The topic grid can be also filtered by using the Clarive [search syntax](getting-started/search-syntax).

<br />
### Filtering

* To filter which topics are shown, use the right side selectors.

<br />
### Statuses

* Each topic status has 3 states:<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Checked: show topics with this status <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;• Crossed: hide topics with this status <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;• Unselected: hide topics with this status (if there's another status checked) or show topics with this status (if there's no other status checked)  <br />

* Therefore, if no status is checked or crossed, then all statuses are shown. 

<br />
### Categories

* Check the topic categories you want to see. If no categories are selected, shows all categories.

<br />
## Collapsed Rows

* Collapsing rows allows viewing more topics per page. 

* Show the topics in a [Kanban view](getting-started/kanban)
