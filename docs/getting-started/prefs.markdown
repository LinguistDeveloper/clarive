title: Setup Your Preferences
---
Your user preferences page contains the default 
settings for your account login and session, 
as well as information that dictates how Clarive and 
other users may interact with you. You can update your user preferences at any time, 
including changing your session settings, your login information, and your 
default workspace or project selection. Your user preferences settings override 
any settings that have been applied to the entire workspace.

Click your user name located in the upper-right corner of the Clarive page and select 
the option `Preferences`

To view or change your preferences information:
