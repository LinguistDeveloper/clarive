### QUERY ###

In this part there are two distinct groups.

On the one hand we have the part in the category where they will be all the categories that we can select our topic.

On the other hand we have the selection portion, in this part we can select by:

 - **Category**: Here we will include all categories we want to see in our report.

 - **Fields**: Here the fields you want displayed in each category they get. For that,
 we search fields on the left side of selection and simply have to drag.

 - **Filter**: If in addition to the category and the fields we want to filter to select only certain parts,
 just drag the group filter components for which we want to filter.

 - **Order**: You can sort a particular field in ascending or descending order.
 To do this drag the field to this section and order in the way that we have selected.
