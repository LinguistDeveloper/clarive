<br />

* Security within Clarive is handled thru a [role system](Concepts/roles).

* All access to administrator functions and user functions are defined through roles. 
Users get then one ore more roles, that way the user’s access to Clarive is limited and controlled. 

* **E.g.**  An “administrator” role can be defined and all privileges can be set on administrator functionality within 
the tool like report definition, topic administration, etc... A role “incident manager” can be defined with 
full access to the topic category “Incident” but e.g. no access to topic category “release” because this topic 
category will be managed by the role “Release manager”.

* A user will get one of more roles and inherit that way the access to the topics he can work on.

* Role administration can be performed by selecting Admin-Roles from the menu bar. 
This will display all the currently available roles in a list view.

* The list view contains the following columns:  <br />


&nbsp; &nbsp;• `Role`: The name of the Role <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• `Description`: The description of the role <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• `Mailbox`: The mailbox specific for the role, for notification purposes <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• `Options`: Summary of all Role actions for this Role

<br />
