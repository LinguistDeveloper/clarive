* A Project is the most common Clarive security [scope](concepts/scope).
* A Clarive project is a collection of [topics](concepts/topic), and is defined according to your organization's requirements. For example, a Clarive project could be: <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• A software development project. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• A system. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• A group of software components. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Or, more commonly, an application.

<br />

* Topics can belong to none, one or more projects, but that is not a requirement. 
For example, Changeset topics must belong to one, and only one, project.
* Releases on the other hand may be multi-project or have no projects.
