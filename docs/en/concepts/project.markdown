A Project is the most common Clarive security [scope](concepts/scope).

A Clarive project is a collection of [topics](concepts/topic), and is defined according to your organization's requirements. For example, a Clarive project could be: 

-  A software development project. 

-  A system. 

-  A group of software components. 

-  Or, more commonly, an application.




Topics can belong to none, one or more projects, but that is not a requirement. 
For example, Changeset topics must belong to one, and only one, project.

Releases on the other hand may be multi-project or have no projects.
