Dashboards represent a fundamental role in the proper use of Clarive.

They can represent the position of the tool so that it can display a lot of information in one place.

To do this, the dashboards are created by Dashboard type rules to add, edit or remove components called *dashlets*.

These dashlets can represent information differently. You can add calendars, tables showing topics that are in a specific state, graphs of a project, etc ...

All these components form a dashboard type rule which can then be used by roles.

The end view is a window where all dashlets included in the rule to show what the user needs appear.
