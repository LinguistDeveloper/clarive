The MID is short for Master ID.

It's an internal counter used to uniquely identify [configuration items](concepts/ci) (CIs) 
in Clarive, including [Topics](concepts/topic), Servers, [Users](admin/user), [Projects](concepts/project),
 [Statuses](concepts/status), etc.

As said, MIDs are unique per installation and usually show up in the Clarive UI prepended by a hash sign:
