* A daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. 
* In Clarive, daemons are special, independent background processes started by the [Dispatcher](admin/dispatcher). 
* Daemons are critical to the correct operation of Clarive, including: <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Job execution <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Event processing <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• [Notifications](admin/notifications) <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• [Scheduled](admin/scheduler) Executions <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Semaphore control

* Accessing the Daemon administration in the Admin Menu: <img class="bali-topic-editor-image"  src="/static/images/daemon.gif" /> Daemons
* In the daemon screen, we can see what daemons are started at a given point in time. 
* These are the standard, out-of-the box daemons that should be running in any typical Clarive installation. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• `service.daemon.email` - Daemon responsible for sending notifications. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• `service.event.daemon` - Daemon responsible for the management of events. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• `service.job.daemon` - Daemon responsible for the execution of passes. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• `service.purge.daemon` - Daemon responsible for the purge. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• `service.schedule daemon` - Responsible for planning. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• `service.sem.daemon` - Daemon responsible for controlling traffic lights.

<br />
