* `cla disp`: Performs operations related to the dispatcher.
* Without any option this command starts the dispatcher service which it’s in charge of starting all active daemons, the way it starts, forked or not, is taken from the service config.
* Dispatcher handles the received signals and performs the appropriate operation, every defined seconds, checks the status of each active daemon, the behaviour is as following: <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• If daemon has been deactivate, dispatcher stops the daemon. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• If daemon has been activated, dispatcher starts the service. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• If daemon is active, checks if it is running and if not, it intends to starts the service again.

* The frecuency that dispatcher checks daemons status is a configuration parameter called ‘frecuency’ and by default it is assigned a value of 30 seconds.
* This command support two different options, they are:

&nbsp; &nbsp;1. `-h`: displays a brief help to the screen: <br />
       

    > cla disp –h
