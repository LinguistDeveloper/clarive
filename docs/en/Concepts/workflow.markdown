* A Clarive workflow is the set of statuses and transitions that a topic
goes through during its lifecycle. 
* There are 2 types of workflows: <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Topic-based, which are for simple workflows <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Rule-based, for complex or reusable workflows <br />

<br />
### Topic Workflows 
* These are simple workflows that apply to a given topic.

<br />
### Rule Workflows
* Typically, most topic categories will do fine
with just a simple, topic workflow. 
* Rule workflows should be used instead for complex decision transitions: <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Project specific flows <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Field-dependend transitions, ie. if "urgency" fieldlet value is "urgent" then skip "promote to QA" <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• External dependent workflow decisions, like calling an external webservice to determine where or how 
to promote the topic. <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;• Field content checks conditional, such as checking that 
a given field has been filled-out before allowing promotion to 
happen.

<br />
### Reusability
* Also, rule workflows are useful as __reusable workflows__. One
workflow rule may be reused in many different topic 
categories.
