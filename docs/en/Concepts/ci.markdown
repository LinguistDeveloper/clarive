* To paraphrase Wikipedia, the term configuration item (CI) refers to the fundamental structural 
unit of a configuration management system. Clarive is such a configuration management system, 
keeping track of all it's configuration entities as CIs in it's database. 

* In Clarive, examples of CIs can be topics (ie. releases, changesets, requirements, test cases), 
servers, user IDs, agents, middleware (such as JBoss or Apache), cloud instances, mainframe nodes, etc. 

* Clarive oversees the life of the CIs through a combination of processes and tools by implementing and enabling the fundamental 
elements of security, change management and audits. 

* Every CI has its unique Master ID in Clarive ([mid](Concepts/mid)).
