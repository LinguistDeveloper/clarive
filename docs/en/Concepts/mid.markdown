title: MID
---

* The MID is short for Master ID.

* It's an internal counter used to uniquely identify configuration items (CIs) in Clarive, including Topics, Servers, 
Users, Statuses, etc. 

* As said, MIDs are unique per installation and usually show up in the Clarive UI prepended by a hash sign:
            
            #3422
