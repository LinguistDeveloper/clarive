Baseliner is a framework for developing application lifecycle
and release management applications. 

Base Software Requirements:

    - Perl 5.10 
    - A database (SQLite3 will suffice)
    - Many CPAN module dependencies

======== INSTALLING THE BASE SOFTWARE =========

Make sure you have an internet connection. 
Baseliner comes loaded with a copy of App::cpanminus and
a auto-installer that tries its best to guess which 
modules are needed. 

Run this command to get started with the cpan auto installer.

bin/bali auto-install

=========== DEPLOYING A DATABASE ==============

1) Create a config file for your database connection

vim baseliner_mine.conf

2) Deploy the database schema

BALI_ENV=mine bin/bali deploy --deploy

3) Load it with some sample data

BALI_ENV=mine bin/bali db load --dir db/sample/es 

========= FIRING UP THE WEB SERVER ============

To run the server in debug mode, execute the following command: 

BASELINER_DEBUG=1 BALI_ENV=t plackup -S twiggy -R lib,etc,features/gitscm/lib --port 3000

Production server:

BALI_ENV=t plackup -S Starman --port 3000
